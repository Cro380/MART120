        <h2>Like this short story here:</h2>
        <h2>It was just this last week</h2>
        <h2>I was playing some games like any normal slackoff would do</h2>
        <h2>But as turned out I wanted a drink of some kind, something sweet</h2>
        <h2>Something, like a cold coke.</h2>
        <h2>As it happens though, I ran out last week</h2>
        <h2>So, Being the responsible human being I am</h2>
        <h2>I went out to get some</h2>
        <h2>Turns out that everywhere was closed as it was 2 am</h2>
        <h2>Depressed and uncaffinated, I walked back to the dorm</h2>
        <h2>Shortly after arriving, I stubbed my toe on the bed</h2>
        <h2>And yes, it hurt</h2>
        <h2>Scary Stuff, huh?</h2>
        <h1>Anyways, Here's an art piece</h1>
